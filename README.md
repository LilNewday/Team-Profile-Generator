# Team Profile Generator

## Description

The goal of this application was to generate an HTML page based off the user's answer from questions. This particular project brings up a page for someone who is creating a team with the Manager role, Engineer role, and Intern role as positions. I got more confortable using npm test during this project and can appreciate it a lot more now.

## Installation

Run the `npm install` command to install the packages.

## Usage

Run `node index.js` and then use the enter key to select your options for your team. After that you just enter in the information you want and then that's it once you finish creating the team you click the finish option and your team page is created.
